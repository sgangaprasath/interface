When we speak of coherence, we refer to the fact that several aspects of a figure have to come together (add harmoniously if that word means anything to you) for it to be presentable. This is particularly relevant when we have multiple sub-figures in a figure. Each of them might look clear and consistent on their own but when placed next to each other it can be jarring. Of course, what is dissonant to one can be musical to the other. So there is some amount of subjectivity here and is often left to the researcher's discretion as to which one is better.
