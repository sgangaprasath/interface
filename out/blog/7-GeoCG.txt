3:T4c5,Pixar characters like the dependable Woody, endearing Dory, or bold
Merida from Brave come to life through a blend of creativity and
mathematics. Designers and artists think in terms of images and shapes,
envisioning characters and worlds, while computers operate on equations
and numerical data. To bridge these two worlds, designers rely on
coordinate geometry. This concept allows them to precisely define the
positions and movements of digital objects within a virtual space.
Geometry, a fundamental branch of mathematics dealing with points,
lines, surfaces, and solids, forms the backbone of computer graphics and
animation. It plays a critical role in defining the shapes, structures,
and movements of digital objects, whether for video games, movies, or
virtual reality. By leveraging geometric principles and algorithms,
animators and graphic designers can craft realistic and visually
stunning images. These algorithms model everything from the curves of
characters to intricate environments, and simulate phenomena like light
and shadows. This precise framework enables artists to translate their
creative visions into detailed and believable 3D animations, captivating
audiences with immersive digital worlds.5:["slug","7-GeoCG","d"]
