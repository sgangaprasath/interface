3:T44b,Noether's theorem is one of the most profound insights in all of
physics. Consider the conservation of energy. Historically, mechanics
evolved through trial and error, with scientists making educated guesses
about which quantities might be useful to measure and which might be
conserved. Even the very fundamental law of conservation of energy was
initially an empirical observation -- a useful construct but its clear
origin was not comprehended. For example, the idea that potential and
kinetic energy could be converted into each other when objects fall or
rise was largely recognized because it was useful. There was no known
fundamental reason that energy should be conserved; it was just observed
that if one properly accounted for all the different forms of energy,
one couldn't create or destroy it, only transform it from one form to
another. Noether's theorem, however, reveals that energy conservation
stems from a plausible origin: the laws of nature should be independent
of time. This means that what seemed like empirical regularities can
actually be derived from symmetry principles.4:T48f,Spontaneous symmetry breaking indicates a situation where, given a
symmetry of equation of motion, the solutions are not invariant under
the action of this symmetry. In other words, the system naturally
settles into a state opposing the symmetry of its underlying laws and
hence the attribute "spontaneous." A simple analogy to explain
spontaneous symmetry breaking was provided by Abdus Salam -- Imagine a
dinner party where guests are seated around a circular table, with a
napkin placed between each pair of neighbors. The table is perfectly
symmetrical, as every guest has a napkin on both sides. Now, if one
guest decides to pick up the napkin on their left or right, this results
in the breaking of symmetry. Now, the other guests know to do the same,
and the left-right symmetry is spontaneously broken. A large number of
physical systems exhibit such spontaneous symmetry-breaking phenomenon
that includes a second-order phase transition in ferromagnets occurring
due to the discontinuous change in order parameter (magnetization), the
appearance of a massless Nambu-Goldstone boson because of the
spontaneous breaking of global gauge symmetry, and many more.5:T4be,, a
protein that forms long, thin fibers within the cell's cytoskeleton,
plays a crucial role in these processes. These actin filaments give the
cell its shape and play a key role in various cellular processes,
including movement. These filaments are dynamic --they can rapidly grow
and shrink by adding or removing actin molecules at their ends. In a
perfectly symmetrical system, actin filaments would grow or shrink
uniformly in all directions, resulting in no net movement of the cell.
However, cells break this symmetry by regulating where and how actin
filaments assemble. This control leads to an asymmetric arrangement of
the filaments. When actin filaments assemble more on one side of the
cell than the other, they generate a protrusive force that pushes the
cell membrane outward in that direction. This asymmetric force drives
the cell to move in a specific direction. Thus, breaking symmetry in
actin filament assembly is crucial for creating directional movement,
enabling the cell to crawl along surfaces or through tissues
effectively. Symmetry provides stability and uniformity, but its
breaking is equally crucial as it enables dynamic processes like cell
movement, development, and adaptability.7:["slug","8-Symmetry","d"]
