3:T473,: Cricut Maker 3 provides precision in cutting
thin materials because of the precision crafting tools. There are 3
types of blades: Fine-Point Blade, Rotary Blade and Knife Blade that
can perform cutting, shearing, embossing, slitting, separating, and
creasing of materials. The Cricut Premium Fine-Point Blade is
designed to cut light to mid-weight materials, such as cardstock,
vinyl, iron-on, poster board, lightweight fabrics, while the Rotary
Blade takes the lead for intricate fabric cuts without the need for
a backing material. The Knife Blade can be used for heavier-duty
projects, which can effortlessly slice through materials like
leather and chipboard. Additionally, the scoring wheel ensures crisp
and accurate folds for perfect paper and cardstock projects. With
these tools in hand, the Cricut Maker 3 opens up a world of
possibilities for creating with precision and creativity. The CAD
software, Cricut Design Space, extends the classical paradigm of GUI
based programming to crafting. The Design Space provides a nice
interface in which we can design the cut patterns which can then be
translated into a physical design.4:T550,:
Because of the variety of cutting tools in Cricut, we can cut a
different materials. The Cricut Maker 3 can cut over 300 materials,
including delicate paper and fabric, and tougher materials like
leather, matboard, and balsa wood. The Maker 3 can cut materials up
to 2.4 mm (3/32") thick with the knife blade. Cricut has released a
new range of smart materials that can be used in Cricut Maker 3
without the use of mats. This is an absolute game changer for
crafters who create larger-than-average designs. Sheets are measured
in the unit of grams per square meter (gsm for short). A standard A4
sheet is 75 gsm whereas a T-shirt is 240 gsm. The larger the gsm of
a sheet, heavier is the material and is often perceived as higher
quality. Sheets having low gsm can be cutted easily with low cutting
pressure but as the gsm of the sheet increases the cutting pressure
should increase accordingly. You can also adjust the pressure for a
fine point blade from 70 to 350 (which is magnitude of pressure
measured in arbitrary units). When adjusting the material settings,
you can start with increments of 5 to 10 to 15 to find the perfect
number. The machine can give you some clues as to whether you need
to adjust your cutting pressure. For example, a brand new blade may
be so sharp that it cuts too deeply. In this case, you may need to
decrease the pressure.6:["slug","5-Kirigami","d"]
