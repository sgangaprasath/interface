Maker 3!

# Technical capability

The Cricut Maker 3 serves as a definitive example of precision
engineering, showcasing an exceptional level of accuracy in handling
various materials. Its prowess extends from delicately cutting intricate
paper designs to seamlessly processing diverse fabrics and even leather.
The Maker 3's remarkable precision is not by chance but rather a result
of meticulous engineering efforts. Every detail of its design has been
carefully crafted and optimized to ensure unparalleled accuracy in
material processing. From the intricacies of paper to the versatility of
fabrics and the resilience of leather, the Cricut Maker 3 stands as a
testament to how precision engineering elevates the capabilities of
crafting tools, delivering reliable and exact results across a spectrum
of creative projects. Cricut Maker has a variety of features that make
it suitable for both crafting and engineering applications:

-   **Precision tools**: Cricut Maker 3 provides precision in cutting
    thin materials because of the precision crafting tools. There are 3
    types of blades: Fine-Point Blade, Rotary Blade and Knife Blade that
    can perform cutting, shearing, embossing, slitting, separating, and
    creasing of materials. The Cricut Premium Fine-Point Blade is
    designed to cut light to mid-weight materials, such as cardstock,
    vinyl, iron-on, poster board, lightweight fabrics, while the Rotary
    Blade takes the lead for intricate fabric cuts without the need for
    a backing material. The Knife Blade can be used for heavier-duty
    projects, which can effortlessly slice through materials like
    leather and chipboard. Additionally, the scoring wheel ensures crisp
    and accurate folds for perfect paper and cardstock projects. With
    these tools in hand, the Cricut Maker 3 opens up a world of
    possibilities for creating with precision and creativity. The CAD
    software, Cricut Design Space, extends the classical paradigm of GUI
    based programming to crafting. The Design Space provides a nice
    interface in which we can design the cut patterns which can then be
    translated into a physical design.

    Because of the variety of cutting tools in Cricut, we can cut a
    different materials. The Cricut Maker 3 can cut over 300 materials,
    including delicate paper and fabric, and tougher materials like
    leather, matboard, and balsa wood. The Maker 3 can cut materials up
    to 2.4 mm (3/32") thick with the knife blade. Cricut has released a
    new range of smart materials that can be used in Cricut Maker 3
    without the use of mats. This is an absolute game changer for
    crafters who create larger-than-average designs. Sheets are measured
    in the unit of grams per square meter (gsm for short). A standard A4
    sheet is 75 gsm whereas a T-shirt is 240 gsm. The larger the gsm of
    a sheet, heavier is the material and is often perceived as higher
    quality. Sheets having low gsm can be cutted easily with low cutting
    pressure but as the gsm of the sheet increases the cutting pressure
    should increase accordingly. You can also adjust the pressure for a
    fine point blade from 70 to 350 (which is magnitude of pressure
    measured in arbitrary units). When adjusting the material settings,
    you can start with increments of 5 to 10 to 15 to find the perfect
    number. The machine can give you some clues as to whether you need
    to adjust your cutting pressure. For example, a brand new blade may
    be so sharp that it cuts too deeply. In this case, you may need to
    decrease the pressure.

-   **Cutting mat**: In the crafting universe of the Cricut Maker 3,
    mats play a crucial role in ensuring precision and stability during
    the cutting process. These mats act as reliable foundations, holding
    your chosen materials securely in place as the machine works its
    magic. With these mats as your crafting sidekicks, the Cricut Maker
    3 ensures your materials stay put, allowing you to bring your
    imaginative designs to life with stability and precision. There are
    3 types of mats: standard grip, strong grip, and light grip.
    Standard grip is a versatile choice for a wide range of materials,
    including cardstock, vinyl, and patterned paper. Strong grip is
    ideal for heavier materials like thick cardstock, fabric with
    backing, or specialty materials. The light grip is suited for
    delicate materials like thin paper, vellum, or light cardstock.

# Crafting process: Single-sheet Kirigami pop-up

In this section we will learn to make a pop-up design from Paul
Jackson's book titled [Cut and Fold Techniques for Pop-Up Designs
Crafting](https://www.amazon.com/Cut-Fold-Techniques-Pop-Up-Designs/dp/1780673272).
The crafting process has primarily 3 major steps:

+   **Creating the SVG in Inkscape**: Begin by designing your kirigami
    pop-up in Inkscape.
    
	<div class="flex justify-center items-center">
	<img src="/images/kirigamiDesign.pdf" alt="Schematic" width="600"/>
	</div>
	
    -   Open Inkscape and create your design.

    -   Use Inkscape's tools to create intricate patterns for your
        kirigami pop-up.

    -   Save your design in SVG format for compatibility with Cricut
        Design Space.

+   **Uploading to Cricut Design Space**: Import your SVG design into
    Cricut Design Space for customization and cutting.

    -   Open Cricut Design Space and create a new project.

    -   Upload your SVG file and adjust the size and orientation as
        needed.

    -   Use the features in Cricut Design Space to fine-tune your
        design.

+   **Cutting with Cricut Maker 3**: Prepare your Cricut Maker 3 for the
    cutting process.

    -   Place a 280 gsm paper on the StrongGrip mat.

    -   Choose the knife edge tool for precise cutting.

    -   Load the mat into the Cricut Maker 3 and initiate the cutting
        process.

creating the design pattern, and uploading it to Cricut Design Space.
