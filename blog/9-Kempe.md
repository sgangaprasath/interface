Kempe's Universality Theorem marks a significant milestone in the history of mechanical linkages, demonstrating that any algebraic curve can be traced by a system of rigid bars and pin joints. This blog post traces the evolution of mechanical design, from the 13th-century Elephant clock to the 18th-century automaton -- `The Writer,' leading up to Kempe's groundbreaking work. It explores the core mechanisms of Kempe's linkages, such as parallelograms, reversor, multiplicator, and additor linkages, and explains their mathematical foundations. Through examples, the post showcases the elegance and ingenuity of Kempe's linkages, emphasizing the creativity and innovation behind the theorem.
