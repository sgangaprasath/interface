In this post, we introduce the concept of Model Predictive Control
(MPC), which originated as a mechanism for decision making in the 1960s
in the petrochemical industry for complex process control with strict
constraints. However, it has found wider applicability, especially in
robotic systems, and is now touted as the 'System 2' for complex
decision tasks. We begin with the fundamental idea behind MPC, how it is
formulated mathematically and then move towards using it in a toy
example: vertical landing of a rocket while using as little thrust as
possible *à la* SpaceX. Along the way, we will see how prediction,
optimization, and constraints come together to form a practical control
strategy.

# Brief history

In the 1960s and 70s, industrial processes such as those in oil
refineries and petrochemical plants had grown too complex with little
guarantees to be handled by traditional control methods. A system like a
distillation column involved multiple inputs, including reflux rate,
reboiler heat, and feed flow, all influencing multiple outputs such as
product composition and temperature across different stages. These
interactions were tightly coupled, the dynamics were slow, and the
effects of any control action could take a long time to appear, all
while the system had to operate within strict limits on temperature,
pressure, and actuator capability. Engineers tried to manage this using
independent PID loops, but these loops acted locally and without
foresight, so correcting one variable often disturbed another, leading
to oscillations and inefficient operation. At some point it became clear
that reacting to the present was not enough, because every action had
consequences that unfolded in the future. The question then shifted from
what input should be applied now to what sequence of inputs should be
applied over time. This change in thinking led to a new approach in
which a model of the system is used to predict how it will evolve, an
optimization problem is solved over a finite horizon to choose inputs
that satisfy constraints and improve performance, and only the first
input is applied before the process is repeated as new information
becomes available. This idea, which came to be known as Model Predictive
Control, was first implemented in the 1970s in forms such as Dynamic
Matrix Control at Shell, where it proved valuable not because it was
elegant, but because it worked under real constraints and improved
economic performance.

The top graph shows the past trajectory of the system resulting in the current state $x_k$, alongside the predicted optimal trajectory approaching the target $x^{\text{ref}}$ over the prediction horizon $N$. The bottom graph displays the corresponding sequence of calculated control inputs. The fundamental idea behind MPC is to compute full future plan but apply only the immediate action $u^*_{k|k}$._

Before we land anything, let us try to understand the mathematical
formalism of MPC. Let us consider a system with state $x_k$ (could be
the position or momentum or any variable that characterizes the system
of interest) at a discrete time $k$. The evolution of the state can be
written as $x_{k+1} = F(x_k, u_k)$, where $u_k$ is the control input of
the system and $F(x_k, u_k)$ is the process that governs the dynamics of
the system. Imagine riding a bicycle, the state $x_k$ describes where
you are, how fast you are moving, and in what direction you are moving.
The control input $u_k$ is the angle to which you rotate the handlebar
or the thrust you provide on the pedal. Those actions determine where
you will be in the next instant, which is the new state $x_{k+1}$.

In the framework of Model Predictive Control, our goal is to decide what
is the 'best' action to take at a particular instant by considering
several future scenarios. That is, at time $k$, we consider a sequence
$$u_{k|k}, \; u_{k+1|k}, \; u_{k+2|k}, \dots$$ to choose the control
input $u_k$. The notation $u_{k+i|k}$ simply means "the control input at
a future time $k+i$, computed at time $k$". Once this future input
sequence is fixed, the model tells us exactly what will happen next.
Using the model $x_{k+1} = F(x_k,u_k)$, we can predict the next state,
$$x_{k+1|k} = F(x_k, u_{k|k}).$$ Using the same equation again, we can
predict the state two steps ahead,
$$x_{k+2|k} = F(x_{k+1|k}, u_{k+1|k}).$$ The state several steps ahead,
$x_{k+j|k}$ for $j \gg 1$, depends on the current state, $x_{k|k}$ and
on all future control inputs, $u_{k+j|k}$ we have chosen. In other
words, once we choose a future control input sequence $u_{k+j|k}$, we
have also chosen a future trajectory for the system. Control is not
purely reactive, it is about shaping the future trajectory.

The obvious next question is: among all possible future input sequences
$u_{k+j|k}$, which one should we choose? To answer this, we introduce a
cost function, $J$. The cost function is a measure of how "good" a
predicted future trajectory is with respect to how we want the system to
behave. In the rocket landing example, we want the predicted height and
velocity to approach zero over time. At the same time, we do not want to
use unnecessarily large thrust. A simple way to express this is to
penalize two quantities: the rocket's position error and the control
effort. Over a horizon of $N$ future steps, we can define $J$ of the
form:

$J = \lambda_x \sum_{i=1}^{N} \| x_{k+i|k} - x_{k+i}^{\text{ref}} \|^2 + \lambda_u \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} \| u_{k+i|k} \|^2.$

In order to find the control input at time-step $k$, our goal is to minimize $J$ for a fixed
horizon $N$. The optimization problem therefore consists of minimizing
$J$ over the future input sequence, subject to the dynamic constraint
$x_{k+1} = F(x_k, u_k)$. The first term in the cost function $J$
penalizes the deviation from the desired trajectory while the second
penalizes excessive control action. Weighting factors $\lambda_{x, u}$
adjust the relative importance of these two objectives. The predicted
outputs depend on the chosen input sequence through the system dynamics.
If the dynamics is linear and the cost is quadratic, the resulting
optimization problem becomes a well known quadratic program. On the
other hand, if the dynamics is nonlinear, the optimization becomes a
nonlinear program. Therefore, the optimal sequence of inputs can be
found by minimizing $J$ with respect to future inputs. The important
aspect of MPC compared to other optimal control frameworks is that after
computing this optimal control input $u^*_{k+j|k}$ at time-step $k$, we
do not apply it for all future times from $k$ to $k+N$, rather we apply
only the first control action, $u^*_{k|k}$. At the next time-step, we
measure the new state $x_{k+1}$, shift the prediction horizon forward,
and solve the optimization problem again. In this way, the control input
is continuously re-evaluated based on updated state information. This
repeated prediction and optimization is what makes Model Predictive
Control adaptive.

In its most general form, a control problem consists of choosing an
input sequence $u_k$ that minimizes a performance metric $J(x_k, u_k)$,
subject to the system dynamics and physical constraints
$x_{k+1} = F(x_k, u_k)$. For a discrete-time system, a finite-horizon
optimal control problem can be written as

$\min_{\{u_0,\dots,u_{N-1}\}} 
\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} J(x_k, u_k) + \Phi(x_N)$

subject to

$x_{k+1} = F(x_k, u_k).$

Here, $J(x_k,u_k)$ represents the stage cost
accumulated at each step and $\Phi(x_N)$ is the terminal cost. Model
Predictive Control operates by repeatedly solving such a finite-horizon
optimal control problem in real time. At each time-step, the problem is
solved using the current state, $x_k$ as the initial condition, the
first control action $u_k$ is applied, we shift the horizon ($N$ steps)
by one discrete time step $k$ to $k+1$. In this sense, MPC is not a
fundamentally different type of controller but rather a real-time
implementation of optimal control. With this background in place, let us
now try to land the rocket.

# Landing the Rocket

</div>

_Schematic of the rocket in the $yz$-plane with its total mass
(including fuel) $m$, orientation $\theta$ and control variables, the
gimbal angle $\delta$ and the thrust $T$. The mass of the rocket $m(t)$
evolves with time as the fuel gets consumed to exert thrust $T(t)$ while
the gimbal angle $\delta(t)$ can be tuned to change the orientation of
the rocket._

Consider the task of vertically landing a rocket which, as we shall see,
is a concrete instance where we can use the general finite-horizon
optimal control framework. Our goal is to plan the motion of a planar
rigid rocket with variable mass whose state at time $t$ is given by

$\mathbf{x}(t) =
\begin{bmatrix}
y(t) & z(t) & \theta(t) & \dot y(t) & \dot z(t) & \dot \theta(t) & m(t)
\end{bmatrix}^\mathsf{T},$

where $y(t)$ and $z(t)$ denote horizontal
and vertical positions, $\theta(t)$ is the pitch angle, $\dot y(t)$,
$\dot z(t)$, and $\dot\theta(t)$ are the corresponding velocities, and
$m(t)$ is the current mass of the rocket. The control input is

$\mathbf{u}(t) =
\begin{bmatrix}
T_{\mathrm{eff}}(t) & \delta(t)
\end{bmatrix}^\mathsf{T},$

where $T_{\mathrm{eff}}(t)$ represents the
thrust magnitude and $\delta(t)$ the gimbal deflection angle, which are
controlled through actuators. The rocket motion can then be described
using Newton's laws for a variable mass rigid body. The thrust acts
along the body axis of the rocket, while gravity acts downward (see
figure above for a schematic of the setup). The translational dynamics is written as

$\ddot y = \frac{T_{\mathrm{eff}}}{m} \sin(\theta + \delta),
\qquad
\ddot z = \frac{T_{\mathrm{eff}}}{m} \cos(\theta + \delta) - g.$

The thrust exerted by the rocket, $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$ must reach zero when
the fuel is empty. This effect is accounted for, while also maintaining
the differentiability required by interior-point solvers, by
approximating the hard engine cutoff using a smooth function. We define
an activation function $\Theta(m)$ that smoothly transitions from $1$ to
$0$ as the mass approaches $m_{\text{dry}}$,

$\Theta(m) = \frac{1}{2} \left[ 1 + \tanh\big(k (m - m_{\text{dry}})\big) \right],$

where $k$ is a steepness parameter that controls the sharpness of the
cutoff. The effective thrust is then defined as the commanded thrust
scaled by this activation factor, $T_{\text{eff}}(T, m) = T \Theta(m).$ The mass depletion dynamics can
be written as a single continuous equation,
$\dot m = - \frac{T_{\text{eff}}(T, m)}{v_e}.$ The translational
dynamics driven by this effective thrust are given by

$\ddot y = \frac{T_{\text{eff}}(T, m)}{m} \sin(\theta + \delta),
\qquad
\ddot z = \frac{T_{\text{eff}}(T, m)}{m} \cos(\theta + \delta) - g,$

and the balance of torque about the center of mass yields the rotational
dynamics,

$\ddot{\theta} = \frac{\ell_{\text{eff}}(m)}{I(m)} \, T_{\text{eff}}(T, m) \sin(\delta).$

These equations define a nonlinear continuous-time model
$\dot{\mathbf{x}}= \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{u})$. To use this model
to perform the landing task using MPC, we need to discretize the
temporal dynamics using a numerical scheme such as the 4-th order Runge
Kutta scheme. This produces a discrete mapping
$\mathbf{x}_{k+1} = \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{x}_k, \mathbf{u}_k)$ given the
current state $\mathbf{x}_k$ and the control input $\mathbf{u}_k$. With
the model in place, we now identify a cost function that measures
performance. For soft landing, position, velocity, and orientation
should approach zero near the landing pad. Using the discrete definition
of the state, $\mathbf{x}_k =
\begin{bmatrix}
y_k & z_k & \theta_k & \dot y_k & \dot z_k & \dot \theta_k & m_k 
\end{bmatrix}^\mathsf{T},$
a reasonable choice of cost function $J(\mathbf{x}_k, \mathbf{u}_k)$ is

$
J(\mathbf{x}_k, \mathbf{u}_k) =
\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \bigg[
(\mathbf{x}_k - \mathbf{x}_{\text{target}})^\mathsf{T}Q (\mathbf{x}_k - \mathbf{x}_{\text{target}}) + W_T T_k + R_T T_k^2 + R_\delta \delta_k^2 \bigg] + (\mathbf{x}_N - \mathbf{x}_{\text{target}})^\mathsf{T}P (\mathbf{x}_N - \mathbf{x}_{\text{target}}).
$

The quadratic term
$(\mathbf{x}_k - \mathbf{x}_{\text{target}})^\mathsf{T}Q (\mathbf{x}_k - \mathbf{x}_{\text{target}})$
penalizes deviation from the desired landing state, ensuring that
position, velocity, and orientation approach zero. The terminal cost
$(\mathbf{x}_N - \mathbf{x}_{\text{target}})^\mathsf{T}P (\mathbf{x}_N - \mathbf{x}_{\text{target}})$
enforces the accuracy in the final time step. The term $R_T T_k^2$
penalizes large thrust magnitudes, encouraging smoother control inputs,
avoiding aggressive actuation. In addition to this, the linear term
$W_T T_k$ directly penalizes the total thrust usage. While the quadratic
term discourages large instantaneous thrust, the linear term discourages
sustained thrust over time, thereby promoting fuel efficient
trajectories.

With the dynamics, cost, and constraints defined, we can now state the
landing task explicitly as a finite horizon optimal control problem,

$\min_{\{\mathbf{x}_k, \mathbf{u}_k\}} J (\mathbf{x}_k, \mathbf{u}_k)$

subject to

$\mathbf{x}_{k+1} = \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{x}_k, \mathbf{u}_k), \quad k=0,\dots,N-1,$

$\mathbf{x}_0 = \mathbf{x}_{\text{measured}},$

$0 \le T_k \le T_{\max}, \qquad |\delta_k| \le \delta_{\max},$

$z_k \ge 0, \qquad m_{\text{dry}} \le m_k \le m_{\text{wet}}.$

Here, the mass is not directly penalized in the tracking term; fuel efficiency
is encouraged through the thrust penalty instead. Solving this problem
at each time-step, applying only the first control input, and then
repeating the procedure with the updated state yields a receding horizon
controller capable of guiding the rocket toward a soft landing while
reacting to disturbances along the way. The animation above shows the
soft-landing of the rocket using this procedure. The `python`-code used
to generate this animation is available
[here](https://github.com/sgangaprasath/MPCTutorial/blob/main/CasADi/RocketMPC.py). This toy model was inspired by the problem set in Robert Stengel's book on Optimal Control and Estimation.

## Computational Implementation

Translating the continuous-time optimal control problem into code
requires a self-consistent discretization procedure. We discretize the
dynamics using a 4th-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) scheme with a time step of
$dt = 0.1$ s and a horizon of $N = 40$ steps (a 4 sec look-ahead). The
resulting Nonlinear Program (NLP) is formulated using `CasADi` library
in python. At each time-step, the NLP is solved using `IPOPT` and the
solver simultaneously optimizes the physical states $\mathbf{x}_k$,
controls $\mathbf{u}_k$ and the Lagrange multipliers that ensure
$\mathbf{x}_{k+1} = \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{x}_k, \mathbf{u}_k)$ and thrust
limits. To achieve real-time feasibility, we use *warm starting*, where
we take the optimal control sequence computed at the previous step as
the initial guess:
$\mathbf{u}^*_{k} = \{ \mathbf{u}_{k|k}, \mathbf{u}_{k+1|k}, \dots, \mathbf{u}_{k+N-1|k} \}$
We shift this sequence forward by one step and duplicate the final input
to create our initial guess:
$\mathbf{u}^{\text{guess}}_{k+1} = \{ \mathbf{u}_{k+1|k}, \mathbf{u}_{k+2|k}, \dots, \mathbf{u}_{k+N-1|k}, \mathbf{u}_{k+N-1|k} \}$
We also apply the same shift to the state trajectory $\mathbf{x}_k$ and
the lagrange multipliers. This guess places the solver close to the next
optimal solution, reducing the computation time and allowing the MPC to
run dynamically in real time.

## Conclusion

Model Predictive Control extends the capabilities of optimal control but
with added adaptability. At every time-step, we use a model of the
system to predict how the future might unfold, choose the sequence of
inputs that best balances performance and effort, apply only the first
input, and then repeat the process with new information. The primary
advantage compared to a fixed controller obtained via an optimal control
procedure is that you allow the environmental perturbations to affect
the system dynamically and adapt to it with an updated controller. The
rocket landing problem is only a toy example; however, the MPC framework
is general enough that it is today applied in chemical industry,
autonomous vehicle planning, active suspension systems, motor drives,
wind turbines and wind farm clusters, and several other places.
